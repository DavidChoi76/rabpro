	abstract = {Abstract. We present HYPERstream, an innovative streamflow routing scheme based on the width function instantaneous unit hydrograph (WFIUH) theory, which is specifically designed to facilitate coupling with weather forecasting and climate models. The proposed routing scheme preserves geomorphological dispersion of the river network when dealing with horizontal hydrological fluxes, irrespective of the computational grid size inherited from the overlaying climate model providing the meteorological forcing. This is achieved by simulating routing within the river network through suitable transfer functions obtained by applying the WFIUH theory to the desired level of detail. The underlying principle is similar to the block-effective dispersion employed in groundwater hydrology, with the transfer functions used to represent the effect on streamflow of morphological heterogeneity at scales smaller than the computational grid. Transfer functions are constructed for each grid cell with respect to the nodes of the network where streamflow is simulated, by taking advantage of the detailed morphological information contained in the digital elevation model (DEM) of the zone of interest. These characteristics make HYPERstream well suited for multi-scale applications, ranging from catchment up to continental scale, and to investigate extreme events (e.g., floods) that require an accurate description of routing through the river network. The routing scheme enjoys parsimony in the adopted parametrization and computational efficiency, leading to a dramatic reduction of the computational effort with respect to full-gridded models at comparable level of accuracy. HYPERstream is designed with a simple and flexible modular structure that allows for the selection of any rainfall-runoff model to be coupled with the routing scheme and the choice of different hillslope processes to be represented, and it makes the framework particularly suitable to massive parallelization, customization according to the specific user needs and preferences, and continuous development and improvements.},

The distinguishing characteristics of nine such algorithms and the experiments that have been conducted to evaluate their performance over the past 15 years are discussed. From there, we consider three sets of enduring challenges: (1) the role of scale and feedback between soil and water, and the need to consider these issues when characterizing the properties of both; (2) the need for dynamic flow routing algorithms and related indices in many landscapes; and (3) some of the as yet unrealized opportunities for treating space and time as continuous variables in the representation of soil water properties. The chapter concludes by noting the current state-of-the-art and where we might go from here},

Since its first release in 2004, SAGA has rapidly developed from a specialized tool for digital terrain analysis to a comprehensive and globally established GIS platform for scientific analysis and modeling. SAGA is coded in C++ in an object oriented design and runs under several operating systems including Windows and Linux. Key functional features of the modular software architecture comprise an application programming interface for the development and implementation of new geoscientific methods, a user friendly graphical user interface with many visualization options, a command line interpreter, and interfaces to interpreted languages like R and Python. The current version 2.1.4 offers more than 600 tools, which are implemented in dynamically loadable libraries or shared objects and represent the broad scopes of SAGA in numerous fields of geoscientific endeavor and beyond. In this paper, we inform about the system's architecture, functionality, and its current state of development and implementation. Furthermore, we highlight the wide spectrum of scientific applications of SAGA in a review of published studies, with special emphasis on the core application areas digital terrain analysis, geomorphology, soil science, climatology and meteorology, as well as remote sensing.},

	abstract = {This dataset represents a compilation of two global and three USA-specific datasets of dam locations and their attributes. The major hurdle toward developing this compilation was the identification of duplicates within the source datasets, especially given the variable precision of dam location coordinates. The most immediately-useful product in this dataset is a spreadsheet (VotE-Dams\_v1.csv) that documents the unique dams found across the datasets, their coordinates, and their ids within the respective source datasets. We do not reproduce the source datasets (GRaND, GOODD, GeoDAR, NID, and EHA) here, but their download locations are provided in the README files ('Overview' tab). Some of the source datasets are provided as shapefiles, which require geospatial data software to open (e.g. QGIS/ArcGIS for graphical display, geopandas for Python, rgdal for R, many others freely available). The provided README documents metadata of the source datasets and provides attribute-linking information (i.e. matches attributes among various source datasets that contain the same, or similar, information but have different names). Note that the README is provided as both .xslx and a collection of .csvs (one per tab in the .xslx file). We suggest using the .xlsx version that preserves images, formatting, and sheets. .xlsx files can be viewed using (free) Google Docs or Microsoft Excel.Finally, we provide Technical Documentation.pdf that describes the procedures used to identify unique and duplicate dams.The title of this dataset refers to our 'Veins of the Earth' (VotE) project, which seeks to provide a flexible, scale-free representation of the Earth's river networks. Dams are a critical component of VotE as they heavily influence flows throughout river networks.},

	abstract = {The Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4): Population Density, Revision 11 consists of estimates of human population density (number of persons per square kilometer) based on counts consistent with national censuses and population registers, for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020. A proportional allocation gridding algorithm, utilizing approximately 13.5 million national and sub-national administrative units, was used to assign population counts to 30 arc-second grid cells. The population density rasters were created by dividing the population count raster for a given target year by the land area raster. The data files were produced as global rasters at 30 arc-second ({\textasciitilde}1 km at the equator) resolution. To enable faster global processing, and in support of research communities, the 30 arc-second count data were aggregated to 2.5 arc-minute, 15 arc-minute, 30 arc-minute and 1 degree resolutions to produce density rasters at these resolutions.},

	abstract = {Topographical relief comprises the vertical and horizontal variations of the Earth’s terrain and drives processes in geomorphology, biogeography, climatology, hydrology and ecology. Its characterisation and assessment, through geomorphometry and feature extraction, is fundamental to numerous environmental modelling and simulation analyses. We, therefore, developed the Geomorpho90m global dataset comprising of different geomorphometric features derived from the MERIT-Digital Elevation Model (DEM) - the best global, high-resolution DEM available. The fully-standardised 26 geomorphometric variables consist of layers that describe the (i) rate of change across the elevation gradient, using first and second derivatives, (ii) ruggedness, and (iii) geomorphological forms. The Geomorpho90m variables are available at 3 ({\textasciitilde}90 m) and 7.5 arc-second ({\textasciitilde}250 m) resolutions under the WGS84 geodetic datum, and 100 m spatial resolution under the Equi7 projection. They are useful for modelling applications in fields such as geomorphology, geology, hydrology, ecology and biogeography.},
